# GasModelsAnnex.jl
A GasModels Extension package for Exploratory Work

[GasModels.jl](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/GasModels.jl) provides an implementation reference for *established* formulations and methods in natural gas optimization, and hence is is not an appropriate location for more exploratory work.  GasModelsAnnex.jl is an extension of GasModels.jl that provides a home for open-source sharing of preliminary and/or exploratory methods in optimization of Gas infrastructure systems.

Due to the exploratory nature of GasModelsAnnex,
- there is minimal documentation and testing
- there are limited code quality and reliablity standards
- anything goes in the annex, more-or-less

Users should be prepared for features that break.

Pull Requests to GasModelsAnnex are always welcome and not subject to significant scrutiny.
